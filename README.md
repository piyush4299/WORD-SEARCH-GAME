Some points to be aware about: 
1. Enter the word you wish to search in puzzle if it's there in any of the 8 valid directions and from the word dictionary it would get hightLighted.
2. To change the dictionary and puzzle you can do it via Components/WordSearch/index.js file through hardcoding it. I know not a good idea but on time constraint couldn't manage many things.
3. After getting all matching words you will win the puzzle and game would restart. One more additional functionality is added for reseting the game using reset button.
4. The word you enter in text box must be from the dictionary on left hand side else it would give error popup as described.
